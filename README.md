# quantum_hackathon_2024

### Champion of Quantum Hackathon organized by QWorld and School of Code and sponsored by SandboxAQ to build apps to tackle the UNâ€™s 17 Sustainable Development Goals!

## Current Problem: 
Despite collecting terabytes of environmental and ecological data around the globData complexity often overwhelm Conservation experts, decision-makers and the general public , leading to delayed responses and apathy, especially in critical ecosystems where every moment can count

## Our Solution:

### An easy-to-use app that bridges the gap between complex data and actionable insights making future impact visible in hope to prevent ecological collapse.
It: 
- Leverages quantum technology to enhance data processing and analysis capabilities.
- Provide actionable intelligence to support biodiversity conservation efforts.
- Identify and analyse key factors affecting biodiversity, such as climate change.
- Create predictive models to forecast the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.
- Facilitate data collection and sharing among conservationists and researchers, and eventually citizen scientists.

## Why Quantum Theory?
Classical Technique Limitations:
- Complex ecological interactions
- Multiple environmental variables
- Non-linear relationships
- Computational intensity
- Data projection accuracy

### Quantum Advantage
- Better handling of uncertainty
- Potentially greater accuracy in long-term predictions
- Inclusion of more environmental variables
- Faster processing of large datasets

### Penny Lane 
A framework that connects quantum circuits and algorithms with classical machine learning algorithms
A bridge between classical ML and quantum computing

### Quantum Variational Circuit Approach
- Implemented a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) for biodiversity prediction
- Used 4-qubit system with 2 parameterised layers
- Combined quantum encoding with classical optimisation
- Leverage quantum superposition for complex pattern recognition in multi-dimensional data

## Overall approach

### Figma - ideation, planning
- started with UN17 goals and chose a topic based on something we were both passionate about - sustainability

### Python - rich ecosystem of libraries, rapid development

### Datasets
- combined BioTIME - global biodiversity measurements
- cached data from meteostat api - historical weather data from stations around the world

### Steps:
- Process and format the data
- Train a predictive model and develop the implementation of the chosen algorithm
- Refine/rebuild
- measure and evaluate the performance
